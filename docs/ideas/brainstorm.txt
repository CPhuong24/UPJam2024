Game Mechanics
- Getting comfort and getting out of it
  + E.g. game controls change something for how you play
         is totally different
  + First starting out everything is expected
  + When you go out of a circle, then mechanicns change
        circle can start big, but maybe gets smaller as time passes
        but you need to adventure out of it
            E.g. you need to collect items to live
- +puzzle+ that changes every occurence / day
  + At the end, you need to put everything back in its place
- Something repetitive, but you can't do the same thing everytime
  + Game logic prevents you from repeating to get comfortable
- Some supernatural force that is making you be outside
  + E.g. weird audio, needing to go fast, change in physics
  + E.g. "being watched"
  + "getting stalked"
- Things looking different when you look at it again
- Wandering a dark map
  + Concept of light starts brighter (can see far), shrinks over time
