General Game Concepts
- Short games that you can do over and over again
- Fast paced / speedruns
    + Fast rounds
- Rouge-like
- Abilities to help player
- Dark-souls like ==> very difficult
  + high skill cap
- hades
- hack and slash
- survival aspects
  + Gather materials
  + building structures
- One hit kill enemies
  + We can kil them easily
- Every time you die, player ages
  + Every time you die its perma
  + As you age, you gain more 
- Some sanity level that gets lower the more you go out
  + you die when it is full
  + touch light gradually goes down
- 

Agreed
- Face paced, danger, time limit, urgency
- Having abilities in a "safe" area, and harder aspect outside
- Being able to see whole map at first / everything is lit up
  and decreases over time

Refined Ideas
- Plaformer like where you see entire map at first but then
 field of view / view range decrases over time
- Open world (like Rust) you can go far
  + Different landmarks
  + You have a house, campfire
  + need
  ===> Turning point in the middle where your house is no more
    and you have to rebuild or game changes
     + Once you venture too far, then everything goes black
     + You cannot go back
     + First part can continue to the second part
- Someone is stalking you and you don't see it
  + Sometimes follows you and sometimes doesn'that
  + Doesn't need to be enemy but adds tension
  + Can be linked to sanity
